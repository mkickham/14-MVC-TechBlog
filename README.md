## Heroku Link

I was given special permission to deploy to Render because I had several issues trying to log in to Heroku. I was given permission by a BCS Learning Assistant, photos below confirm this agreement. However, I do not think the assistant realized that Render does not support MySQL. In discussing this with my instructor and TA, I decided the best course of action was to submit the assignment and then hope that Heroku will get back to me unlocking my account.

The above video on screencastify will confirm that the website is indeed functional.
